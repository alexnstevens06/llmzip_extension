The library stood at the edge of the old quarter, its stone walls dark with centuries of rain. Margaret pushed through the heavy oak door, breathing in that familiar scent of aged paper and wood polish that no digital archive could ever replicate.

She had been the head librarian for thirty-two years, arriving each morning at seven o'clock to sort the overnight returns and check the humidity sensors in the rare books room. The routine had become as natural as breathing, each day following the gentle rhythm of books shelved and books found, questions asked and questions answered.

But today was different. The letter from the city council lay folded in her cardigan pocket, its bureaucratic language barely concealing the finality of its message. The library would close at the end of the month. Budget constraints, declining visitors, the inevitable march of digital transformation. The words blurred together into a single verdict.

She walked through the stacks, trailing her fingers along the spines. Each shelf held its own geography of knowledge. The history section, where old Professor Hawkins had spent every Tuesday afternoon for two decades. The children's corner, where generations of young readers had discovered worlds beyond their neighborhoods. The reference desk, where she had helped thousands of patrons navigate the labyrinth of human knowledge.

The afternoon light slanted through the tall windows, casting long rectangles of gold across the reading tables. A few regulars sat in their customary spots. Arthur with his crossword puzzles. Mrs. Chen with her stack of gardening magazines. Young Theo, who came after school to do homework because his apartment was too noisy.
