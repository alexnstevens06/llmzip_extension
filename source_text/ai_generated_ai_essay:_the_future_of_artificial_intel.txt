Artificial intelligence has undergone remarkable transformation since its conceptual origins in the mid-twentieth century. What began as theoretical explorations in mathematical logic and computation has evolved into a practical technology that touches nearly every aspect of modern life. From natural language processing to computer vision, from autonomous vehicles to medical diagnostics, AI systems now perform tasks that were once thought to require uniquely human intelligence.

The development of deep learning, powered by neural networks with millions or billions of parameters, has been particularly transformative. These models learn patterns from vast quantities of data, developing representations that capture subtle statistical regularities invisible to human analysts. Large language models, trained on extensive text corpora, can generate coherent prose, translate between languages, summarize documents, and answer questions across diverse domains.

However, significant challenges remain. Current AI systems lack genuine understanding of the concepts they manipulate. They can produce plausible-sounding text without comprehending its meaning, identify objects in images without understanding their physical properties, and optimize objectives without appreciating the broader consequences of their actions. This limitation, sometimes called the alignment problem, has prompted extensive research into making AI systems more reliable, interpretable, and aligned with human values.

The economic implications of artificial intelligence are equally profound. Automation threatens to displace workers in manufacturing, transportation, customer service, and even knowledge work. Simultaneously, AI creates new opportunities in data science, machine learning engineering, AI safety research, and countless application domains.
