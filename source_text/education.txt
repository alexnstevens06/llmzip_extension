Formal education pedagogy is guided by various theoretical frameworks that provide a conceptual foundation for teaching and learning practices within structured institutional settings. Key theoretical frameworks commonly applied in formal education pedagogy include:

Behaviorism: This framework, championed by theorists such as B.F. Skinner, posits that learning is a change in observable behavior influenced by external stimuli and reinforcement. In formal education, behaviorist approaches often involve directive instruction, lectures, repetitive practice, and objective assessments like multiple-choice questions.

Cognitivism: Focusing on internal mental processes, cognitive theory views learning as the acquisition, processing, and storage of information, where new knowledge is built upon existing understanding. Pedagogical strategies informed by cognitivism often incorporate visual tools, organizers, and activities that promote problem-solving and critical thinking.

Constructivism: Theorists such as Jean Piaget and Jerome Bruner proposed that learners actively construct their own understanding and knowledge of the world through experiences and reflection. Social constructivism, particularly influenced by Lev Vygotsky, emphasizes the importance of social interaction in this knowledge-building process. Constructivist instruction in formal settings is often social and exploratory, leveraging critical thinking activities, collaborative projects, and hands-on experiments.
