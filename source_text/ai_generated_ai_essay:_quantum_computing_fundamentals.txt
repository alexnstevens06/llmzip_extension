Quantum computing harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics to process information in fundamentally different ways than classical computers. While traditional computers store data as binary digits, or bits, that exist in one of two states, zero or one, quantum computers use quantum bits, or qubits, that can exist in superpositions of both states simultaneously.

This property of superposition allows quantum computers to explore multiple computational pathways in parallel. When combined with quantum entanglement, where the states of two or more qubits become correlated regardless of physical distance, quantum computers can solve certain problems exponentially faster than their classical counterparts.

The most well-known quantum algorithm is Shor's algorithm for integer factorization. Classical computers require exponentially increasing time to factor large numbers, a difficulty that underpins modern cryptographic systems like RSA. Shor's algorithm can factor these same numbers in polynomial time, potentially rendering current encryption methods obsolete once sufficiently powerful quantum computers become available.

Grover's algorithm provides a quadratic speedup for unstructured search problems. Given a database of N items, a classical computer requires on average N/2 queries to find a specific item, while Grover's algorithm accomplishes the same task in roughly the square root of N queries. This speedup has applications in optimization, machine learning, and database search.

Building practical quantum computers remains enormously challenging. Qubits are extremely sensitive to environmental disturbances, a phenomenon known as decoherence. Maintaining quantum states long enough to perform useful computations requires sophisticated error correction techniques and operating temperatures near absolute zero.
