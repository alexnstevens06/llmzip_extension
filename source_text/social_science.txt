A common strategy for structuring a social science research introduction is the "upside-down triangle" model, moving from general information to specific details. The process begins with a broad introduction to the topic, establishing the research's importance and context within the wider field.

Next, the background literature and current understanding are summarized, showing the progression of research and what is already known. This section provides sufficient context to set up the study, including definitions, histories, or theories that help the reader understand the problem.

Identifying the knowledge gap is critical. Researchers must clearly articulate what is not known or what gaps exist in the current literature. This is often presented as a puzzle or a problem that needs to be solved.

Finally, the study terminates by stating the purpose, research question, or hypothesis. This includes a clear and concise statement of the objective and what the research aims to achieve. Sociology research paper introductions often deal with the study of social aggregates, groups, institutions, and the causes and consequences of changes within them. They focus on human social interaction and can involve extensive qualitative data analysis.
